# Improved Detection of Fraud Cases for E-Commerce and Bank Transactions
**Adey Innovations Inc. – Fraud Detection Project**  
*December 2025*

An end-to-end machine learning project to develop accurate and robust fraud detection models for e-commerce and bank credit card transactions. The models incorporate geolocation analysis, transaction velocity patterns, and advanced ensemble techniques while addressing severe class imbalance and providing explainable insights via SHAP.

---
## Business Goal
Adey Innovations Inc., a leader in financial technology, seeks to deliver cutting-edge fraud detection solutions that:

- **Accurately identify fraudulent transactions** in real-time to minimize financial losses for e-commerce and banking clients.  
- **Reduce false positives** to maintain excellent customer experience and avoid alienating legitimate users.  
- **Leverage geolocation and behavioral signals** (e.g., time between signup and purchase, transaction frequency) for stronger fraud detection.  
- **Provide transparent, interpretable models** that build trust with customers, partners, and regulators.

A successful system will enable faster risk mitigation, lower fraud-related losses, and stronger confidence in digital transactions.

## Project Overview
This project analyzes two highly imbalanced datasets:  
1. E-commerce transactions (`Fraud_Data.csv`) with rich user, device, IP, and timing details.  
2. Anonymized bank credit card transactions (`creditcard.csv`) with PCA-transformed features.

We perform thorough EDA, geolocation merging, feature engineering, imbalance handling (SMOTE and SMOTETomek), model training, and SHAP-based explainability to derive actionable business rules.

### Key Deliverables
- [x] Comprehensive EDA with visualizations of fraud patterns and class imbalance  
- [x] Geolocation integration (IP → Country) and rich feature engineering (velocity, time-since-signup, etc.)  
- [x] Resampling strategy for severe class imbalance (SMOTE for e-commerce, SMOTETomek for credit card)  
- [x] Baseline Logistic Regression + advanced ensemble (Random Forest/XGBoost/LightGBM)  
- [x] Evaluation using AUC-PR, F1-Score, Precision-Recall curves, and Confusion Matrix  
- [ ] SHAP global/local explanations with business recommendations  
- [x] Clean, organized, and reproducible repository

## Fraud Detection Business Understanding
### Key Challenges in Fraud Detection
1. **Extreme Class Imbalance**  
   Fraudulent transactions typically represent <<1% of total volume. Standard accuracy is misleading — we prioritize **Precision-Recall AUC** and **F1-score**.

2. **Security vs. Customer Experience Trade-off**  
   - High recall → catches more fraud but risks more false positives (customer friction).  
   - High precision → fewer false alarms but may miss real fraud (financial loss).  
   **Strategy:** Tune models and thresholds to optimize business cost (false negative cost >> false positive cost).

3. **Need for Explainability**  
   Financial institutions require interpretable decisions for regulatory compliance, audit trails, and deriving actionable rules (e.g., "flag transactions from high-risk countries within 1 hour of signup").

4. **Real-Time Requirements**  
   Models must be fast and deployable for live scoring while incorporating contextual signals like device reuse and geolocation anomalies.
